# better-autoclicker
An autoclicker a bit different than your normal one â€” it works by just holding the left mouse button down and it'll turn on if the mouse button is still being held down after a customizable delay.


# Instructions
1. Install required libraries using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Run main.py
3. Customize your settings
4. Have fun auto clicking


# Info
Yes, autoclickers shouldn't be written in Python but it's the language I'm learning atm (only language I know also :D).
