# better-autoclicker
An autoclicker a bit different than your normal one â€” it works by just holding the left mouse button down and it'll turn on if the mouse button is still being held down after a customizable delay.

Includes:
1. Custom clicking delay
2. Deviation for the clicking delay to minimize detectability
3. Toggle key

This autoclicker isn't intented for games like Cookie Clicker but more for games like Minecraft where it can be used in PvP.

# Instructions
1. Install required libraries using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Run main.py
3. Customize your settings
4. Have fun auto clicking



# Info
Yes, autoclickers shouldn't be written in Python but it's the language I'm learning atm (only language I know also :D).
